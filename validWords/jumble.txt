1. A jumble of a word w is obtained by rearranging the letters of the word in some random order.
For example, if w = “tpra”, then “rapt”, “part”, “trap”, “ptra” are some of the jumbled words you
can get out of w. Of these rapt, part, and trap are legit words in the dictionary whereas tpra and
ptra are not. Given a String w, the goal is to find if some jumble of w will give a legit word in the
dictionary, and if so output at least one of those; otherwise, say that w does not have a legit
jumbled word in the dictionary. Example: w =”ogd”, the answer is “god” or “dog”; if w = “pttt”,
then w does not have a legit jumbled word in the dictionary. You can use our
EnglishWordList.txt as the reference dictionary for valid/legit words. The given String can be of
any length and you can assume it only has lowercase alphabetic characters.

2. Using the dictionary of words in the file EnglishWordList.txt, and using hashing, find and print
the number of duplicate words and how many times they are duplicated. For instance, if “cat”
appears 5 times in the file, then you would print cat 5
